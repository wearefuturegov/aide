getting_equipment:
  info: |
    Getting equipment yourself is often quicker than waiting for council support.  There are a lot of resources out there that can help with access to equipment, like equipment loan services, grants and advice.
    Did you know that a lot of shops like Amazon, Argos and Boots sell equipment too! Itâ€™s easy to ask in the store or search online, but itâ€™s always good to speak with someone for advice on what to buy.
    Newcastle City Council can often help with payment and access to certain equipment.
  self_or_council: What would you like to learn more about?
  choices:
    - Access myself
    - Council support
