assessment: |
  Newcastle City Council's Community Health and Social Care Direct team can arrange a free assessment for equipment, aids and adaptations.

  It will help assess what your needs are and see if you can receive some help from the council. The assessment also gives you the opportunity to discuss your needs.

getting_equipment:
  info: |
    Getting equipment yourself is often quicker than waiting for council support.  There are a lot of resources out there that can help with access to equipment, like equipment loan services, grants and advice.
    Did you know that a lot of shops like Amazon, Argos and Boots sell equipment too! Itâ€™s easy to ask in the store or search online, but itâ€™s always good to speak with someone for advice on what to buy.
    Newcastle City Council can often help with payment and access to certain equipment.
